# Burger taster!

### Objective
Utilize MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a custom ORM. 
Use MVC design pattern: Use Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. 

### Overview

App begins by showing the user a menu of burger options: 
![Initial interface](public/assets/img/initialinterface.png)

User is able to add a burger with a custom name: 
![Adding a burger](public/assets/img/addingburger.png)

The new burger is added to the menu: 
![Burger is added](public/assets/img/addedburger.png)

The user is then able to "devour the burger," or if it already has been eaten, make a new one. The burger moves between two menus.

### Remaining improvements
- _Deploying to Heroku_. Encountering errors while deploying to Heroku. Cannot seem to link the database correctly. 
- _Visuals_. CSS could definitely be more pro-style. 
- _Reloading_. App doesn't always reload when a burger status is changed.
